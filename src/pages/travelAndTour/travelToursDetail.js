          The trek starts off going through many small villages along the path, 
          and its very interesting seeing people go about their daily lives there, 
          alongside sweeping beautiful views of greenery over the mountains,
           passing cows and donkeys carrying loads (the only version of Himalayan traffic jams youll see!) and lots of bridges to cross over the river.
            As the altitude goes higher the whole landscape changes to an alpine one with more shrubs and gravel and views of the snowy mountains above, and the climbing becomes colder, windier and more difficult because of the altitude, with some sections of steep climbing. Our guide Bibek was amazing he not only was cheery and easy to get along with, always motivating us with a Lets do!, but he gave us invaluable advice about what we needed for each days trek, what the route would be like, and recommendations on buying things like hiking poles and scarves where we would have struggled without them. Not only that but he has great knowledge of the surrounding mountains and views. He was also very understanding when things were harder for us, and always made sure we were well taken care of! Our safety and comfort were the most important things to him he always checked in on how we were feeling, took the lead when the trail was tough to show us the safest and easiest route, 
          and kept us safe from the traffic mentioned above.
          ant amazing views and an amazing experience flying over the mountains coming in to Lukla.

          â€œMy partner and I went on this unforgettable trek for 12 days to EBC and had an amazing time.
           There were issues with the flights on the day we were due to fly to Lukla but the company booked us a helicopter at no extra charge,
            which meant amazing views and an amazing experience flying over the mountains coming in to Lukla.
